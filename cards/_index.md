This is my personal documentation site. It's built using Zola. These docs are written primarily for my benefit, so context is often omitted for brevity.

Most of these cards act as a compressed index of things I tend to forget but often need. They're recognition triggers, tailored specifically for me.

**Warning:** This site is heavily *under-developed*. I've added as little infrastructure as possible in order to foucs on content. I'll add more styling and layout stuff eventually, but right now, I'm mostly focused on maximizing personal utility.
