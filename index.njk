This is a work-in-progress/experiment. It's extremely rough around the edges and is mostly developed for my benefit.
However, I've decided to make it public in case it has value to someone else. The content here is somewhat volatile.
I can't promise link rot won't happen or that things won't be removed. If you want to preserve a copy of something you read here,
I suggest saving the relevant page(s) as "web page, HTML only" or screenshotting the portions you want to keep.

<ul>
{% for post in collections.all %}
    {% if post.url !== "/" %}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title | default(post.url) }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
