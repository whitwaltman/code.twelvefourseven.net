<p>Some facts about me:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I write code. Sometimes for money, sometimes for fun.</li>
    <li>I have a poor working memory. {{ inlineNote(text = "I have pretty severe ADHD. I'm medicated, but meds can only do so much.") }}</li>
    <li>I tend to use a relatively small, but consistent set of tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    To compensate for my working memory, I often try to <mark>externalize information</mark>.
    This is one such attempt to do so.
</p>

<p>
    The bulk of this website is "card" pages.
    I've adopted <a href="https://ratfactor.com/cards/">the idea</a> from Dave Gauer,
    but it's also just a natural extension of how I've been doing things for years.
    At any given moment, I'm likely to have at least a dozen index cards or sticky notes
    strewn across my desk or adorning the walls around me. But physical clutter is hard
    to sort through and search, and it's not durable and portable in the way a website can be.
    {{ inlineNote(text = "I feel it necessary to add the caveat that digital artifacts are just as fragile as physical ones, if not moreso in certain cases. However, a website is generally more reliable than an index card stuffed in my desk.") }}
</p>

<p>
    These cards are written primarily for my benefit (see above), so context is often omitted for brevity.
    Most of the information you find here can be extracted and assembled from various docs and tutorials that exist on the web.
    I typically won't add a card until I've had to search for the answer to the same problem 3+ times.
    At that point, it clearly represents a gap in my retrieval process.
</p>

<p>
    I try to regularly refactor my cards (when necessary) in order to keep them useful and usable.
    Unfortunately, that means that links will sometimes break and information may disappear or be moved elsewhere.
    I do, however, keep the <a href="{{ site.repo }}">source</a> for this website public,
    so you can always go back and view the commit history for a specific file if you're looking for something that's no longer there.
