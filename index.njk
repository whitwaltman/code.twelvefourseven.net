<p>This is a work-in-progress/experiment. It's extremely rough around the edges and is mostly developed for my benefit.
However, I've decided to make it public in case it has value to someone else.</p>

<p>The content here is somewhat volatile. I can't promise link rot won't happen or that things won't be removed. If you want to preserve a copy of something you read here,
I suggest saving the relevant page(s) as "web page, HTML only" or screenshotting the portions you want to keep.</p>

<h3>Posts</h3>
<ul>
{% for post in collections.posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title | default(post.url) }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h3>Tags</h3>
<ul>
{% for tag in collections.tagList %}
    <li><a href="/tags/{{ tag }}">{{ tag }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
