title = "When to use Svelte"
+++

- was working on a small game prototype last week
- started with html and vanilla js for simplicity
- quickly reached a bottleneck and was writing more code than i needed to for something simple
- svelte was a much better choice, and one i probably should've started with earlier

- still working on identifying when to use a tool/framework to solve a problem
	- this was a bit of an odd case since i didn't have a clear problem in mind when i started writing code
- i think in retrospect if i had planned it out a little before jumping in to development, i would have realized that using svelte would've been a smarter approach from the beginning
