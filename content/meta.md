I've experimented with storing "snippets" and code notes for a while now, but none of my solutions have ever really stuck. I think part of the problem was that I was trying to do too many things and that I wasn't clear about the problem I was trying to solve.

With generative systems drastically reducing the cost of production, value concentration has shifted to discernment: deciding what things should be made and why.

I can't solve that with documentation, but I can augment my abilities with strategically-designed content that reduces bottlenecks in my process.

This site contains sort of a "tiered" knowledge system. The lower, base tier can be described as a tactical reference. It's made up of minimal, scannable snippets and reminders that aim to **reduce friction**. It's things like commands, syntax patterns, configs, or gotchas. These are going to have less surface value to people that aren't me because they're specifically written to target areas of my thinking surface that are under-indexed. In this way, it becomes a pattern recall engine of sorts.

The upper level tier is made up of insight notes. These are conceptual breakthroughs, mental models, analogies, and design principles. These should compound long-term value.
