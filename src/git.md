Note that I'm using my personal git aliases here for concision.

| command | purpose | details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git br -d <branch>` | delete a git branch | force with `-D` |
| `git br -m <new_name>` | rename a git branch | |
| `git clone --depth 1` | shallow git clone | only fetch the most recent commit |

`git remote remove origin`
confirm with `git rv`
