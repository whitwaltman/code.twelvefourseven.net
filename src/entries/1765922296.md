summary: shift the letters in a string to the right by one position
---
```ruby
string = "banana"
string.chars.map { |c| (c.ord + 1).chr }.join
```

NOTE: this only works if you don't shift past the alphabet's length (e.g. if you have "zebra", it won't shift properly). 

I realized this while making a little caesar shift playground. I hadn't thought of it earlier because I wrote this code for a very specific / singular use case, which did not hit this edge case.
