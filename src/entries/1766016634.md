```ruby
nums = (1..4).to_a
# => [1, 2, 3, 4]
total = nums.reduce(0) do |sum, num|
    sum + num
end
# => 10
```

`reduce` is generally preferred over `inject`[1] although they're aliases of each other[2]. "this is not a hard requirement; if the use of the alias enhances readability, it's ok to use it"
