[Here's](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html) a list of all the supported named character references in HTML.

However, because [this website is written for me](/about), I'm gonna catalog the ones I use most often.

|glyph|name|code point|
|---|---|---|
|&|amp;|U+00026|
|&crarr;|crarr;|U+021B5|
|&DoubleRightArrow;|DoubleRightArrow;|U+021D2|
