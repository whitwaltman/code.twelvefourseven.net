Note: `reduce` is an alias for `inject` in Ruby. Stylistically, you should [prefer `reduce`](https://rubystyle.guide/#map-find-select-reduce-include-size) over `inject`, unless the latter enhances readability. In other domains, this method is sometimes called `fold`.

I don't remember why I wrote this code. It is most likely related to a puzzle I was solving. I think I was maybe trying to shift letters by a certain number of spaces in order to mimic some cipher? But honestly, it could've been anything. 

```ruby
word = "CYAN"
# => CYAN
alpha = ("A".."Z").to_a
# =>
# ["A",
# ...
alpha.index(word[0])
# => 2
word.chars
# => ["C", "Y", "A", "N"]
vals = word.chars.map { |c| (alpha.index(c) + 1) % 9 }
# => [3, 7, 1, 5]
vals.reduce { |x, sum| sum += x }
# => 16
word.chars.map { |c| alpha.index(c) + 1 % 9 }
# => [3, 25, 1, 14]
```
